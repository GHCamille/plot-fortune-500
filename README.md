## Objective
My objective is only to create a banner for my website. But I want this banner to have a meaning for me. I decided to draw a graph symbolizing the number of women to run Fortune 500 businesses.

## Fortune 500 ?
The Fortune 500 is an annual list compiled and published by Fortune magazine that ranks 500 of the largest United States corporations by total revenue for their respective fiscal years. The list includes publicly held companies, along with privately held companies for which revenues are publicly available.


## Plot 
I wanted the colors to remind people of stars in the night sky.
